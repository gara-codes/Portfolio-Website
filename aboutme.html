            <h3>About Me</h3>
                 <p>My name is Garainaya Mnisi and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of the Witwatersrand and I am passionate about building software and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I aspire to be a Software Engineer that is also well-versed in Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>I program quite often in my spare time and I love learning new technologies and seeing how their strengths have made them so popular. I try as much as possible to learn concepts outside my school curriculum in order to make sure I’m up-to-date with the latest trends. One way I’ve done this recently is by receiving a certificate in Full Stack Development issued by the FNB App Academy I took part in.</p>

<p>Besides programming on my own, I also love participating in hackathons as a lot of the time, they simulate a real-world environment of being tasked to solve a problem under tight time constraints. I’ve participated in both the Entelect University Cup hackathon and the Adapt IT Social good hackathon this year - both of which challenged my collaboration and problem-solving skills.</p>
